## üìä Project Overview

We worked with two datasets:
1. **Demographics Data** ‚Äì customer attributes.
2. **Purchasing Data** ‚Äì purchasing incidence, promotions, prices, and brand information.

### Objectives
- Perform descriptive and statistical analysis to understand the data.
- Clean and prepare datasets for modeling.
- Segment customers using **clustering techniques** based on demographic features.
- Analyze **purchasing behavior** across segments.
- Estimate **price elasticity** (both overall and per brand).
- Provide **data-driven pricing recommendations**.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
   - Merge demographic and purchasing datasets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries and visualizations.
   - Correlation analysis and feature distribution insights.

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Applied clustering (e.g., K-Means or Hierarchical).
   - Interpreted customer segments based on demographics.

4. **Price Elasticity Analysis**
   - Modeled how changes in price impact demand.
   - Estimated optimal price ranges for each brand.

5. **Recommendations**
   - Suggested actionable pricing and marketing strategies based on findings.
